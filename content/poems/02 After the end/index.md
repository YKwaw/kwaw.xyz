The passing of a family friend at the start of this year had me thinking a lot about death. I don't really know how to think or write about the topic of my own inevitable passing, but think the below is pretty decent go at expressing it.
___
## After the End

Please don't pretend I was perfect,<br>
As I move from he is, to he was,<br>
I don't want to pass into legend,<br>
Speak of me as I am,<br>
A man of this world,<br>
Flawed, searching, striving to be better.<br>
Let me be real,<br>
After the end.<br>

Please don't be sad,<br>
Don't grieve for the end of my story,<br>
While my time may have passed,<br>
You still have yours to live,<br>
Know I loved you more than I could express,<br>
Your happiness means the world to me.<br>
No need to cry,<br>
After the end.<br>

Please try to remember me,<br>
If only for a little,<br>
They say you die twice,<br>
Once when you pass from this life,<br>
Then again when you pass from memory,<br>
So let me rest, before I pass again.<br>
Remember me,<br>
After the end.<br>

_RIP, I'll make sure to remember._
