## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon minced ginger 
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic 
- 1/2 cup tamari
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1/ 3cup lightly packed brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil 
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch 
- 1 16-ounce (454 g) block firm tofu, cut into 12-inch cubes
- Rice

## Instructions

- In a bowl, combine the ginger, garlic, tamari, honey, brown sugar, sesame oil, vinegar, red pepper flakes, and cornstarch and whisk until well blended. Place the tofu cubes in the marinade and stir to coat evenly. Refrigerate for at least 3 to 6 hours and up to overnight (a shorter marinating time is possible in a pinch, but the flavor of the marinade will penetrate the tofu deeper the longer you let it sit).
- Preheat the oven to 425°F
- Spread the cubes (marinade included) on a large unlined sheet tray and roast for 10 minutes. Remove the tray from the oven, turn over the cubes of tofu, and roast for anothe' 5 minutes until all the tofu is golden brown and the sauce has caramelized and turned sticky. Remove from the oven and allow the tofu to coo completely, then refrigerate in an airtight container until ready to use. The cubed tofu will keep for up to 5 days.
